# Analog monosynth with digital control path

## The idea:
- A stripped down version of the [Josh Oxford Ribbon Synth](https://github.com/JordanAceto/josh_Ox_ribbon_synth)
- No integrated ribbon controller
- MIDI and CV inputs

## Status: work in progress
- circuit board design is started but not finished
  - VCO and VCF boards are farther along than Modulation board
- front panel design is started but not finished
  - It's reasonably complete, but may still change
- rust language microcontroller code for the Modulation board is not started
